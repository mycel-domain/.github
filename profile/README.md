# 🍄 Mycel 🍄

Mycel is an **intent-centric interface** to solve complexity in multi-chain and bring bilion users for Web3 by eliminating the need for them to understand complex blockchain concepts like gas fees and transactions.

By adopting Mycel's intent-centric interface, protocols like Restaking Protocols and Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) can provide a user-friendly experience, where actions are reduced to simple intents that hide the complex details of blockchain operations.
This approach enables a broader range of applications to become more user-friendly, inviting a vast new audience to explore.
